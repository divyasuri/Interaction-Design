# InteractionDesignProjects
This repository contains submissions for my Interaction Design and Usability Testing class. I chose to do a complete redesign of a local LA record store, using principles of user research and interaction design. This is a work in progress, I am currently completing my usability testing and improving my prototype. 

Tools: Keynote, Sketch, Principle, Validately
