# Atomic Records Redesign 
This repository contains submissions for my Interaction Design and Usability Testing class. I chose to do a complete redesign of a local LA record store, using principles of user research and interaction design. This was my first foray into an interaction design project using the tools below and I came out of the experience with a renewed passion for converting user research into appealing products. 

Tools: Keynote, Sketch, Principle, Validately
